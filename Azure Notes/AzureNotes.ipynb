	-Network Interface
	-Network Security Group
	-Public Ip address
	-Virtual machine
	-Virtual Network(This can be same for multiple vms)
2)Configuration:

Azure Service Bus vs Storage Queue

Key advantages of Service Bus queues include:

    Supports larger messages size (256 KB per message versus 64 KB)
    Supports both at-least-once and at-most-once delivery - choose between a very small chance that a message is lost or a very small chance it is handled twice
    Guarantees first-in-first-out (FIFO) order - messages are handled in the same order they are added (although FIFO is the normal operation of a queue, it is not guaranteed for every message)
    Can group multiple messages into a transaction - if one message in the transaction fails to be delivered, all messages in the transaction will not be delivered
    Supports role-based security
    Does not require destination components to continuously poll the queue

Advantages of storage queues:

    Supports unlimited queue size (versus 80-GB limit for Service Bus queues)
    Maintains a log of all messages


to display the primary connection string for your Service Bus namespace.:

az servicebus namespace authorization-rule keys list \
    --resource-group Learn-6fcafe6b-cd2c-4670-955d-73b86b5dd03b \
    --name RootManageSharedAccessKey \
    --query primaryConnectionString \
    --output tsv \
    --namespace-name salesteamappsrikant16sept

Endpoint=sb://salesteamappsrikant16sept.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=RootManageSharedAccessKey;SharedAccessKey=SJxtY/jN13inIuypLeRNlMtx7nvFxeYbJyHPHTBkXIk=



TO see no of messages in the queue:
az servicebus queue show \
    --resource-group Learn-6fcafe6b-cd2c-4670-955d-73b86b5dd03b \
    --name salesmessages \
    --query messageCount \
    --namespace-name salesteamappsrikant16sept


_________________________________________________________________________
Azure Storage Queue
When you create a storage account that will contain queues, you should consider the following settings:

-    Queues are only available as part of Azure general-purpose storage accounts (v1 or v2). You cannot add them to Blob storage accounts.

-    The Access tier setting which is shown for StorageV2 accounts applies only to Blob storage and does not affect queues.

-    You should choose a location that is close to either the source components or destination components or (preferably) both.

-    Data is always replicated to multiple servers to guard against disk failures and other hardware problems. You have a choice of replication strategies: Locally Redundant Storage (LRS) is low-cost but vulnerable to disasters that affect an entire data center while Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS) replicates data to other Azure data centers. Choose the replication strategy that meets your redundancy needs.

-    The performance tier determines how your message are stored: Standard uses magnetic drives while Premium uses solid-state drives. Choose Standard if you expect peaks in demand to be short. Consider Premium if queue length sometimes becomes long and you need to minimize the time to access messages.

-    Require secure transfer if sensitive information may pass through the queue. This setting ensures that all connections to the queue are encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).


Command to create storage account: 

Use the az storage account create command to create the storage account. You can type the command into the Cloud Shell window on the right.

The command needs several parameters:
Parameter 	Value
--name 	Sets the name. Remember that storage accounts use the name to generate a public URL - so it has to be unique. In addition, the account name must be between 3 and 24 characters, and be composed of numbers and lowercase letters only. We recommend you use the prefix articles with a random number suffix but you can use whatever you like.
-g 	Supplies the Resource Group, use Learn-e1f667ad-e8a6-41ae-ac6d-ce72e7f1d4e5 as the value.
--kind 	Sets the Storage Account type - use StorageV2 to create a general-purpose V2 account.
--sku 	Sets the Replication and Storage type, it defaults to Standard_RAGRS. Let's use Standard_LRS which means it's only locally redundant within the data center.
-l 	Sets the Location independent of the resource group owner. It's optional, but you can use it to place the queue in a different region than the resource group. Place it close to you, choosing from the below list of available regions in the sandbox.

Azure Event Hub

Azure Event Hubs is a cloud-based, event-processing service that's capable of receiving and processing millions of events per second. Event Hubs acts as a front door for an event pipeline, where it receives incoming data and stores it until processing resources are available.

-Pricing
There are three pricing tiers for Azure Event Hubs: Basic, Standard, and Dedicated. The tiers differ in terms of supported connections, number of available Consumer groups, and throughput. When using Azure CLI to create an Event Hubs namespace, if you don't specify a pricing tier, the default of Standard (20 Consumer groups, 1000 Brokered connections) is assigned.

-Event subscribers are applications that use one of two supported programmatic methods to receive and process events from an Event Hub.
:EventHubReceiver - A simple method that provides limited management options.
:EventProcessorHost - An efficient method that well use later in this module.



Create a namespace CLI:
az eventhubs namespace create --name $NS_NAME
(Resource Group & Location are set to default)

Get connection string of the namespace:
az eventhubs namespace authorization-rule keys list --name RootManageSharedAccessKey --namespace-name $NS_NAME


Create an event hub:
az eventhubs eventhub create --name $HUB_NAME --namespace-name $NS_NAME

View details of event hub:
az eventhubs eventhub show --namespace-name $NS_NAME --name $HUB_NAME



The following parameters are required to create an Event Hub:

Event Hub name - Event Hub name that is unique within your subscription and:
        Is between 1 and 50 characters long
        Contains only letters, numbers, periods, hyphens, and underscores
        Starts and ends with a letter or number

Partition Count - The number of partitions required in an Event Hub (between 2 and 32). This should be directly related to the expected number of concurrent consumers. This cannot be changed after the hub has been created. The partition separates the message stream, so that consumer or receiver applications only need to read a specific subset of the data stream. If not defined, this defaults to 4.

Message Retention - The number of days (between 1 and 7) that messages will remain available, if the data stream needs to be replayed for any reason. If not defined, this defaults to 7.

-Azure Virtual Machine: 

Here are some guidelines based on the scenario you are targeting
What are you doing? 	Consider these sizes
General use computing/web: Testing and development, small to medium databases, or low to medium traffic web servers. 	B, Dsv3, Dv3, DSv2, Dv2
Heavy computational tasks: Medium traffic web servers, network appliances, batch processes, and application servers. 	Fsv2, Fs, F
Large memory usage: Relational database servers, medium to large caches, and in-memory analytics. 	Esv3, Ev3, M, GS, G, DSv2, Dv2
Data storage and processing: Big data, SQL, and NoSQL databases that need high disk throughput and I/O. 	Ls
Heavy graphics rendering or video editing, as well as model training and inferencing (ND) with deep learning. 	NV, NC, NCv2, NCv3, ND
High-performance computing (HPC): Your workloads need the fastest and most powerful CPU virtual machines with optional high-throughput network interfaces. 	H
